To "on-board" a device onto a Wifi network by default the AirMeter.io generates an SSID based upon the MAC address of the Wifi adapter and opens an access point. The SSID and a randomly generated password are displayed on the LCD screen.

When one connects a phone or a laptop to this network the browser is redirected a captive portal. Through this portal the device Web UI can be accessed.
