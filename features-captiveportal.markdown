At first an *AirMeter.io* device boots and starts an access point with a captive portal (secured using a random WPA2 key) to allow the device to be configured.

Onboarding a device onto a Wifi network is achieved by connecting to the device's SSID and random password using a phone or other device. These connection details are displayed on the *AirMeter.io* device's screen.

When a phone or a laptop connects to this SSID the browser is automatically redirected a captive portal. Through this portal the device Web UI can be accessed and configured to connect to the desired network.

Once an *AirMeter.io* device is connected to a wireless network in station mode the captive portal is disabled.
