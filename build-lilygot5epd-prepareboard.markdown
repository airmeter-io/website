## Build Steps 

### Step 1 - Attach 6 lengths of wire.

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

|Wire|Six colors of wire.|

The lengths of wire should be attached to the following pins.

|Color|Purpose|LilyGO Pin|
|--|--|--|
|Black|Ground|GND|
|Red|3.3v|3.3|
|Blue|I2C SDA|21|
|Green|I2C SCL|22|
|White|Enable Sensor|19|
|Yellow|Reading Ready|15|

Enough wire must be left to complete the following steps. See image below:-

### Step 2 - Route & bundle wires

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

Route the wires towards the end of the LilyGo board opposite the buttons and USB ports. Create bends and use tape to secure the wires as a neat bundle.

See image below for desired result:-

### Step 2 - Solder 8 way socket

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

The objective of this step is to connect each of the wires to the appropriate pin on the 8 way socket. This socket will attach to the 8 way header on the base of the sensor assembly.

The pin connections must be as follows:-

|Color|Purpose|Socket PIN|
|--|--|--|
|Black|Ground|1|
|Red|3.3v|2|
|Blue|I2C SDA|3|
|Green|I2C SCL|4|
|White|Enable Sensor|7|
|Yellow|Reading Ready|8|


Clearly the aim here is to achieve enough slack to make assembly possible but also to avoid using excessive lengths of wire and damaging connections during assembly.
