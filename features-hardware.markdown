ESP32 & ESP8266 family MCUs made by Espressif can be used as the platform on which the build a device. Both chip families have a wide range of boards available in different form factors and bundled peripheral components.

The firmware is built upon the [Espressif ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) and [Espressif ESP-8266-RTOS](https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_RTOS_SDK) SDKs and therefore is designed to operate on the MCUs supported by these SDKs namely ESP32, ESP32-S2. ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C6 & ESP8266. These SDKs were chosen due the popularity of these MCUs with makers and existing CO2 monitoring projects.

AirMeter.io is primarily about the Software & user experience. Reference designs are given as a starting point to makers but it is intended also to bring new features to existing designs & builds which satisfy the hardware requirements.
