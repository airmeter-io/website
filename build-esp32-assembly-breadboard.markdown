For illustration the build options are explained in terms of being built on a breadboard. This is not recommended except for development and test purposes. 

As long as the components are connected in same manner any reliable method may be used such a printed PCB or directly soldered wires.

Choose the sensor and connection method from the following list for the instructions for the chosen CO2 sensor.
- [Senseair Sunrise UART (3.3V)](/make/esp32/breadboard_assembly/senseair/sunrise-uart) 
- [Senseair Sunrise I2C (3.3V)](/make/esp32/breadboard_assembly/senseair/sunrise-i2c)
- [Cubic CM1106/CM1107 UART (5V)](/make/esp32/breadboard_assembly/cubic/CM110x-uart)
- [Winsen MH-Z19B/MH-Z19C/MH-Z14 UART (5V)](/make/esp32/breadboard_assembly/winsen/MHZ1x)
