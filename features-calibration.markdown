Appropriate calibration is critical in terms of maintaining accuracy. AirMeter.io makes the process of forcing background calibration and configuring ABC (Automatic Background Calibration) a breeze. Wizards are provided to guide users through the required steps.

The AirMeter.io web interface provides wizards to managing calibration. These will be replicated on the physical display/buttons in soon.

### Frequency of Calibration
The optimum interval between calibrations depends on a number of factors:
- The sensor design and characteristics e.g. some sensors need to be calibrated more often than others.
- Whether it has received shocks which can misalign the internal components. 
- Over time the internal components in a sensor wear which will alter the raw readings.
- The extent of drift in readings is dependent on the sensor model. Some drift significantly more than others.
