CO2 sensors need to be recalibrated periodically. The optimum interval between calibrations depends on a number of factors:
- The sensor design and characteristics. Some sensors need to be calibrated more often than others.
- Whether the sensor receives shocks & wear/tear. Over time the bulb in a sensor can change in brightness and shocks can misalign components.
- General drift in readings the extent of this appears to be very sensor model dependent.

The AirMeter.io provides rich web wizard style workflows for managing calibration. This workflow will be replicated with the physical display/buttons in future development.
