This section describes how to build a portable battery operated device with an electronic paper display. 

See the following subsections for a brief outline of each part of the build process and links to further detail.

### [Sensor Assembly](/make/sensor-assemblies/sunrise)
This is a 7cm x 3cm PCB on which the sensors are mounted. On the underside which is exposed when it is screwed in place is a 8 way right angle male PCB connector to connect to the LilyGO board.

### [Prepare LilyGO board](/make/lilygo213/prepare)
The LilyGO 2.13in EPD board must have an 8 way connector and wires soldered to it to allow it to connect to the sensor assembly.

### [3D print case & assemble](/make/lilygo213/assemble)
The case must be printed using a suitable 3D printer. The LilyGO board and sensor assembly must be assembled in a specific order.
