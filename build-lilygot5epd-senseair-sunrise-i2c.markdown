## Overview
The Sensor Assembly is a small PCB (7cm x 3cm) on which the sensors are mounted. On the underside which is exposed when it is screwed in place is a set of 8 way right angle PCB pins.

These pins connect to the 8 way PCB socket wired to the [LILYGOÂ® TTGO T5 board](/make/epd213/prepare).

Once completed this part will appear in as shown in the image below.

NOTE: This requires a custom Sensor Assembly PCB which means these steps can be performed in minutes, for a manually wired board see  the <a href="/make/sensor-assemblies/sunrise-universalpcb">manually wired universal pcb instructions</a>.

## Build Steps 

- [Step 1 - Attach the 8 way right angle pin header](#step-1---attach-the-8-way-right-angle-pin-header)
- [Step 2 - Mounting CO2 Sensor pin headers](#step-2---mounting-co2-sensor-pin-headers)
- [Step 3 - Attach 4 way PCB Socket for BME280 board](#step-3---attach-4-way-pcb-socket-for-bme280-board)
- [Step 4 - Attach Sunrise CO2 Sensor](#step-4---attach-sunrise-co2-sensor)
 
### Step 1 - Attach the 8 way right angle pin header

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

|Part|Description|
|--|--|
|SensorAssemblyV1.0|The AirMeter.io Sensor Assembly PCB (See [https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly](https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly))|
|2.54mm pin header|8 Way, 1 row, right angle pin header|

At one thin (10 holes/3cm wide) end of the PCB attach the pin header to the PCB using solder. The pins must face inwards towards the other thin end of the PCB. 

After completing this step the PCB should appear as in the the image below.

### Step 2 - Mounting CO2 Sensor pin headers

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

|Part|Description|
|--|--|
|SensorAssemblyV1.0|The AirMeter.io Sensor Assembly PCB (See [https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly](https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly))|
|2.54mm pin header|4 Way, 1 row, straight pin header|
|2.54mm pin header|5 Way, 1 row, straight pin header|

The pin headers need to be adjusted so that the minimum length extrudes from the rear of the PCB. The pins will stick out on the PCB side to which the sensor is attached. This is the side of the PCB that the pins are labeled.

<strong>This is important to allow the PCB to fit within the case.</strong>

The parts for this step are shown in the following image:-

<ol>
<li>Solder the 5 way pin header to the 5 holes marked "Sunrise 1" on the PCB. The pins should stick out on the side which is labeled "Sunrise 1" and an extrusion on the other side of the PCB must be minimised.
<li>
Solder the 4 way pin header to the 4 holes marked "Sunrise 2" on the PCB. The pins should stick out on the side which is labeled "Sunrise 2" and an extrusion on the other side of the PCB must be minimised.
</li>
</ol>

The PCB will appear as shown in the image below when this step is completed.

### Step 3 - Attach 4 way PCB Socket for BME280 board

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

|Part|Description|
|--|--|
|SensorAssemblyV1.0|The AirMeter.io Sensor Assembly PCB (See [https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly](https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly))|
|2.54mm socket|4 Way 1 Row Straight PCB Socket Through Hole|


<img src="/buildimages/v1.0/pcbsunrise-step3-parts.jpg" style="width:auto" height="154" alt="Parts required for step 3 of assembly"/>

<ol>
<li>Locate the BME280 holes on the PCB.</li>
<li>Mount the 4 way socket using solder on the side which is labeled BME280.</li>
</ol>

The PCB will appear as shown in the image below when this step is completed.

### Step 4 - Attach Sunrise CO2 Sensor

Get the following parts ready before starting this step.

|Part|Description|
|--|--|
|SensorAssemblyV1.0|The AirMeter.io Sensor Assembly PCB (See [https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly](https://github.com/airmeter-io/SensorAssembly))|
|006-0-0007 or 006-0-0008|Senseair Sunrise CO2 sensor|

Place the Senseair Sunrise CO2 sensor on the pins attached in the previous step. The pins must align exactly with the Senseair Sunrise PCB if they don't the previous step was not completed correctly.

<img src="/buildimages/v1.0/pcbsunrise-step4-parts.jpg" style="width:auto" height="154" alt="Parts required for step 4 of assembly"/>

Solder each of the pin headers to the Senseair Sunrise sensor PCB. The PCB will appear as shown in the image below when this step is completed.
