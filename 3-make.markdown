At its core the *AirMeter.io* firmware solely needs the supported components to be connected together in one of the supported "configurations". The enclosure, power management and methods of manufacture depend on the individual project.

# Third-party Build Guides

*AirMeter.io* was built to enable creators and designers to develop and deliver their carefully crafted devices with a feature rich firmware.  Without the significant software development time/resource investment that entails.

This section will link to third-party external build guides & sites if & when they become available.

In other words, your project goes here :).

# Reference Design Guidelines

In time *AirMeter.io* will provide reference designs & guidelines to showcase the ideal (but boring!) design parameters as a starting point to new designs to allow them to hit the ground running.  

# Platform Specific Documentation
The two families of MCU that are are supported are ESP32 & ESP8266. Click on the family being targeted by the device or development project.
