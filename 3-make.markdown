At its core the *AirMeter.io* firmware solely needs the supported components to be connected together in one of the supported "configurations". The enclosure, power management and methods of manufacture depend on the individual project.

This is an extremely portable CO2 monitor with great battery life even when connected to WIFI.

The design has been optimised to take advantage of the ePaper display giving live readings, graphing and the ability to calibrate just using the device itself.

See [ePaper Build Guide](/make/epd213) for full instructions on how to build this reference design.

## Third-party Build Guides

*AirMeter.io* was built to enable creators and designers to develop and deliver their carefully crafted devices with a feature rich firmware.  Without the significant software development time/resource investment that entails.

This section will link to third-party external build guides & sites if & when they become available.

In other words, your project goes here :).
