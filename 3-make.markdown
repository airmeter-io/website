At its core the *AirMeter.io* firmware solely needs the supported components to be connected together in one of the supported "configurations". The enclosure, power management and methods of manufacture depend on the individual project.

# Third-party Build Guides

*AirMeter.io* is designed to enable makers, designers and manufactures to develop and deliver their carefully crafted devices with a high quality feature rich firmware. But without the significant software development time/resource investment that a software package like this entails.

This section will link to third-party external build guides & sites if & when they become available.

In other words, your project goes here :).

# Reference Designs

In time *AirMeter.io* will provide reference designs for 3D printed enclosures & PCB layouts as a starting point for new device design projects. 

# Platform Specific Documentation
Two families of MCU are supported and others may be added in the future. Click on the family being targeted by your device or development project.
