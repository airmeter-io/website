At its core the AirMeter.io firmware solely needs the supported components to be connected together in one of the supported "configurations". 

The simplest but least reliable way to achieve this is to use a breadboard. This is a valuable approach for research and development however other more permanent methods must be used for "production" devices. There a many possible options depending on the skills and equipment available. 

- Printing and assembly of PCBs - Reference designs will be provided in time to act as a starting point.
- Printing non assembled PCBs, Solderable Breadboards or jumper leads
- 3D Printing of enclosures
