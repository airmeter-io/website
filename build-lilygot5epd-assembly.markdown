## Required Components

Before assembly can begin ensure you have the following components prepared and ready.

- A completely assembled [Sensor Assembly](/make/sensor-assemblies/sunrise).
- A [LILYGO® TTGO T5 board](/make/epd213/prepare) with the connector attached.
- A [FT103450P with a 1.25mm JST connector attached](/make/epd213/battery).
- The 3D printed parts from the next section.
- 10x M2x6mm self tapping screws.

## 3D Printed Parts
The casing for the CO2 monitor is printed using a 3D printer. The models are available at http://github/todo. The table below describes each part and its purpose.

|Part|Dimensions (mm)|Description|

|<img src="/buildimages/v1.0/back.png" style="width:auto" height="100" alt="The sensor assembly screws into this part. "/>|78.4x41.4x21.5| The sensor assembly screws into this part onto pillars. The sensors themselves face upwards into the area in which there are grills to allow airflow. The pillars have been sized to ensure a minimum clearance around a Senseair Sunrise. |
